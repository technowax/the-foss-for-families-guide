# The FOSS for Families Guide

Welcome!

This documentation site is a guide on how to use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to make your family's digital life more secure, private, and controlled.

Now-a-days, parents and guardians who are raising children today, are faced with so many streaming services, apps, services and devices that it can be overwhelming. They're often forced to pay for subscriptions, or give up give up control to service providers, they may lose privacy, or even lose access to their own data or services that they were using without any notice.

## FAQ

### What effort is required?

A bunch of effort. Self hosting and setting up your own services and software does need a lot of time - which most parents and guardians do not have. It also requires some technical background and some reading (eg, of this guide), but hopefully the effort investment will pay for itself in the long run. Many people find this is a hobby that they enjoy, and it can be a great way to learn new skills.
